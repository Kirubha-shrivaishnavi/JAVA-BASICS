Write a program that reads marks in five subjects and calculates the average. Based on the average, return a fun and encouraging grade according to the following rules:

Average ≥ 90 → "Excellent!"
Average ≥ 80 and < 90 → "Great Job!"
Average ≥ 70 and < 80 → "Good Effort!"
Average ≥ 50 and < 70 → "Keep Trying!"
Average < 50 → "Better Luck Next Time!"
Constraints:
0 <= marks in each subject <= 100

Input Format:
Five integers, each on a separate line, representing marks in five subjects.

Output Format:
A single line containing the fun grade.

Sample Input:
100
90
80
70
60

Sample Output:
Great Job!

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();
      int d = sc.nextInt();
      int e = sc.nextInt();
      int tot = a+b+c+d+e;
      int avg = tot/5;
      if(avg>=90){
        System.out.println("Excellent!");
      }else if(avg>=80 && avg<90){
        System.out.println("Great Job!");
      }else if(avg>=70 && avg<80){
        System.out.println("Good Effort!");
      }else if(avg>=50 && avg<70){
        System.out.println("Keep Trying!");
      }else{
        System.out.println("Better Luck Next Time!");
      }
  }
}
