Write a program that reads a year as input and prints whether it is a leap year or not.

Print "yes" if the year is a leap year.

Print "no" if the year is not a leap year.

A leap year occurs every 4 years, but some years are not leap years even if divisible by 4. Some special years are also leap years. Your program should determine this correctly based on the input year.

Input Format:

A single integer representing the year.

Output Format:

Print "yes" if it is a leap year.

Print "no" if it is not a leap year.

Sample Input:
2000

Sample Output:
yes

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      if(a%4==0 && a%100!=0 || a%400==0){
        System.out.println("yes");
      }else{
        System.out.println("no");
      }
  }
}
