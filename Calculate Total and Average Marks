John wants to learn how to calculate the total and average marks of a student in programming.
Write a program that reads the student's name and marks in five subjects. Then calculate and print:

Total marks (sum of all five subjects)
Average marks (sum divided by 5, rounded to two decimal places)
Input Format:

First input: studentâ€™s name (string)
Second input: marks in subject 1 (integer)
Third input: marks in subject 2 (integer)
Fourth input: marks in subject 3 (integer)
Fifth input: marks in subject 4 (integer)
Sixth input: marks in subject 5 (integer)
Output Format:

First line: Student Name: <name>
Second line: Total Marks: <total>
Third line: Average Marks: <average> (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Smaple Input :
Venkades
45
78
62
55
80

Smaple Output :
Student Name: Venkades
Total Marks: 320
Average Marks: 64.00

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String a = sc.nextLine();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();
      int d = sc.nextInt();
      int e = sc.nextInt();
      int f = sc.nextInt();
      int t  = b+c+d+e+f;
      double avg = t/5.0;
      System.out.println("Student Name: "+a);
      System.out.println("Total Marks: "+t);
      System.out.printf("Average Marks: %.2f\n",avg);
      
  }
}
