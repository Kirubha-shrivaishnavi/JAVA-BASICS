Write a program to calculate the train fare based on the passenger’s age and distance to travel. The fare rules are:

Children (age < 12): 50% of standard fare per km
Adults (12 ≤ age ≤ 59): 100% of standard fare per km
Seniors (age ≥ 60): 75% of standard fare per km
Standard fare per km: Rs 5
The program should calculate the total fare based on distance and age category.

Constraints:
1 <= age <= 120
1 <= distance <= 1000

Input Format:

First line: An integer denoting age of the passenger
Second line: An integer denoting distance in km
Output Format:
Print the total fare in rupees as an integer or float.

Sample Input:
10
100

Sample Output:
250

Explanation:
Age < 12 → 50% of fare
Standard fare = 100 × 5 = 500
Discounted fare = 500 × 0.5 = 250


SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
     float fare = b*5;
     if (a <12){
       System.out.println((int)(fare*0.5));
     }else if(a>=60){
       System.out.println((int)(fare*0.75));
     }else{
       System.out.println((int)fare);
     }
  }
}
