Write a program that takes a number as input and prints a famous Tamil cinema reference based on divisibility:

If the number is divisible by 3 only, print "Thala"
If the number is divisible by 5 only, print "Thalapathy"
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "ThalaThalapathy"
If the number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, print the number itself
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000

Input Format:
A single integer n.

Output Format:
Print "Thala", "Thalapathy", "ThalaThalapathy", or the number itself, based on the rules above.

Sample Input:
30

Sample Output:
ThalaThalapathy

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      if(a%3 == 0 && a%5 != 0){
        System.out.println("Thala");
      }else if(a%5 == 0 && a%3 != 0){
        System.out.println("Thalapathy");
      }else if(a%3 ==0 &&  a%5 ==0){
        System.out.println("ThalaThalapathy");
      }else{
        System.out.println(a);
      }
  }
}
